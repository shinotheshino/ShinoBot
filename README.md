# ShinoBot

A simple Discord bot written using Eris.

I created this bot as an experiment to dip my feet into Eris. Previously, I only have experience using discord.js,
so this is a good learning experience for me.

### My thoughts on Eris

Though this bot isn't particularly large, I really do enjoy the lack of a heavy caching system, and the whole
provided API feels much nicer to work with compared to the one in discord.js. I do quite like Eris, though
I admit it is missing some substantial QoL features such as an embed builder.

### Setting up

1.  Clone the project
2.  `yarn`
3.  `yarn tsc`
4.  Fill out `config.json` (copy it from `config.example.json` for a template)
5.  `node dist/main.js`
